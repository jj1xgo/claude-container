# Deny-by-default egress allowlist. Ported from the official Anthropic devcontainer
# (anthropics/claude-code .devcontainer/init-firewall.sh) with these deviations:
#   - No ipset: rootless podman cannot autoload the host's ip_set kernel module,
#     so plain per-CIDR iptables rules in a dedicated chain are used instead.
#   - DNS egress is limited to the resolvers in /etc/resolv.conf, not port 53 at large.
#   - IPv6 egress is dropped entirely: the allowlist resolves A records only, and
#     upstream's IPv4-only rules would otherwise leave IPv6 (pasta) as a bypass.
#   - Extra allowed domains come from /etc/claude-container/allowed-domains.txt,
#     baked into the image at build time (root-owned, not writable by node).
#   - Domain-backed CIDR rules carry a generation tag (see add_cidr_tagged below)
#     so `--refresh-domains` mode can keep up with short-TTL CDN IP rotation
#     without a full rule flush (observed 2026-07: cyberjapandata.gsi.go.jp
#     behind CloudFront rotates its entire A-record set every 13-60s, and a
#     one-shot startup resolution goes stale well within a long session).
# Runs as root via sudo from entrypoint.sh. Must stay fail-closed on the initial
# run: any error aborts container startup (opt out with CLAUDE_CONTAINER_NO_FIREWALL=1).
# `--refresh-domains` mode (see bottom) is a lightweight, fail-open exception to
# that rule — it's a periodic background touch-up, not the startup safety gate.
